⚔️ Verven
A Strategic Medieval Web Game Project

🎮 About the Project
Verven is a medieval-themed strategic web game inspired by classic browser games like Tribal Wars. You build villages, gather resources, raise armies, conquer provinces and manage your small realm to dominate the map.

The project is in development as a modern web app with full-stack technologies, tailored for scalability, clean architecture, and extensibility.

Verven is being built with a clear vision:

"Old-school strategy, modern technologies, infinite possibilities."
